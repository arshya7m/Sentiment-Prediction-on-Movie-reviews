# Sentiment-Prediction-on-Movie-reviews

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the sentiment of movie reviews as positive or negative. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, and the model is trained using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms to achieve accurate sentiment predictions.

### Tech Stack:

Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, MatplotLib
### Approach:

Text preprocessing

Feature extraction using TF-IDF 
### Model training using the following classifiers:
Logistic Regression: A linear classifier for binary classification.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): A fast and efficient approach for training large-scale models.

LightGBM: A gradient boosting model that is faster and more efficient on large datasets.

Evaluation using metrics like accuracy

### Results:
Performance comparison of Logistic Regression, SGD, and LightGBM models, with accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
